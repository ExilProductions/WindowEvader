# WindowEvader

Ever feel like your windows are just a little too... still? Like they're just sitting there, waiting for you to click on them? Well, I made this little app to make them a bit more lively.

## What it does

This program makes all your windows a bit "touch sensitive". When your mouse cursor gets too close to a window, it will gently move away, like it's shy. The faster you move your mouse, the more it will react. If a window hits the edge of the screen, it will teleport to the opposite side.

It's a fun little distraction that makes your desktop feel a bit more alive.

## How to use it

Just run the `WindowEvader.exe` file. You can build it yourself using the provided solution file.

## How to stop it

The program runs in the background without a visible window. To stop it, you can run the `kill_window_evader.bat` script located in the `Scripts` folder.
